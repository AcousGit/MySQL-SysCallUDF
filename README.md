# MySQL-SysCallUDF
Mysyschar.cc is a User defined Function which allows users to run system calls directly from MySQL clients. This UDF allows the attacker to see the answers of system calls. 
 
It works on LINUX based systems and was created for pentest (not for sys admin). 
I code it after reading an article of Bernardo Damele about SQL injections.

Now if you want to use it for pentest read my article on SQLInjection (It Will Come Soon ^^).
