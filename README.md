# MySQL-SysCallUDF
Mysyschar.cc is a User defined Function which allows users to execute system calls directly from MySQL clients.
It works on LINUX based systems and was created for pentest (not for sys admin).

[User's manual](https://github.com/AcousGit/MySQL-SysCallUDF/wiki "User's Manual")

Now if you want to use it for pentest read my article on SQLInjection (It Will Come Soon ^^).
